## Overview

**KIND Mindz** is our winning entry in the 2023 KIND Perfect Pitch Challenge, an integrated three-pillar campaign designed to deepen Gen Z engagement with KIND bars by merging social, experiential, and rewards-driven touchpoints. Over a six-week sprint (Sep–Oct ’23), our team of three FAMU undergraduates combined consumer surveys, competitive analysis, and rapid prototyping to deliver:

- **Social Media Takeover**  
  A TikTok- and Instagram-first “#KindMindz” challenge inviting users to share bite-sized self-care rituals with KIND bars, amplified by micro-influencer partnerships.

- **AR Motivation Boards**  
  In-store QR-triggered AR experiences overlaying positive affirmations and habit-tracking gamification, turning routine snack aisles into interactive “kindness boosters.”

- **KIND Rewards Refresh**  
  A digital spin-to-win rewards hub, accessible via packaging QR codes, that lets shoppers earn free bars, exclusive merch, or micro-donations to mental-health nonprofits.

Together, these elements create a seamless omnichannel loop driving both immediate trials (**+6.5% projected net sales lift**) and longer-term brand loyalty.

**My Role:**  
Led user research (surveys & interviews), conducted brand, market, and competitor research, synthesized data into personas and word-cloud insights, performed competitive benchmarking, and designed high-fidelity Figma prototypes of our AR-driven omnichannel concept.

## Problem Statement

> **How can KIND reach Gen Z (born after 1995) shoppers to further expand its consumer base (household penetration and brand awareness) and drive sales and profit while staying true to KIND’s mission and core values?**

## Research & Analysis

### A. Market Research

**Quick Facts & Trends**  
- In 2022, 17% more people started buying “better-for-you” food products.  
- 43% of consumers buy snack nuts for high protein; 39% for treat/indulgence; 36% for heart health.  
- “High” claims (fiber, vitamins, protein) outperform “low” claims (sugar, calorie, fat) in appeal.  
- 71% of consumers look for high-protein snacks.  
- Smartphone apps have risen as a key influencer in snack purchases.  
- Partnerships with delivery platforms and metaverse experiences can drive last-mile revenue.  
- 49% of consumers snack 3+ times per day (up 4 pts in 2 years), with younger generations snacking more.  
- 25% of consumers buy what’s on sale versus their favored brands.  
- 48% of consumers look for multi-variety packs.

**Marketing Trends & Competitor Tactics**  
- Retailers like Kroger use “farmers market” messaging and vegetable-centric labels.  
- Diet claims (“gluten-free,” “keto”) convey health value; “better-for-you” brands emphasize ingredient inclusion (“50% more fruit”).  
- Private-label innovators (Aldi, Trader Joe’s, Whole Foods) attract healthy snackers with variety and discovery.  
- Simple “recipe cards” for fresh, indulgent snacks can appeal to produce-seeking consumers.

### B. Survey Data Analysis

**Methodology**  
Over a three-week period, we ran three complementary surveys (n≈114 total) via:

- **Online**: Campus GroupMe, Instagram, Twitter  
- **In-person**: FAMU & FSU student centers, gyms, events

| Survey                   | Sample Size | Focus                                   |
|--------------------------|------------:|-----------------------------------------|
| Brand Awareness Survey   |          60 | Familiarity & product knowledge         |
| Snack Habit Survey       |          41 | Snacking frequency, channels, priorities|
| Product Testing Survey   |          13 | Taste-test feedback on new prototypes   |

**Key Questions**  
- **Importance Ratings**: 1–5 for Convenience, Taste, Cost, Health Benefits  
- **Channel Distribution**: Where respondents first encountered the survey  
- **Open Feedback**: Likes/dislikes, desired features, purchase likelihood

**Findings**  
- **Neutral “Healthy Nothing” Response**  
  The word cloud (n≈131) is dominated by “healthy” and “nothing,” revealing that half of Gen Zers have almost no reaction when they hear “KIND.”  

- **Low Awareness, High Intent**  
  In our Brand Awareness survey (n=41), 39% rated KIND just 1/10 in familiarity—yet nearly that same cohort (39%) stated they would still purchase a KIND bar.

- **Snack Feature Priorities**  
  - Taste (avg. 4.50) and Cost (4.20) are top purchase drivers.  
  - Convenience (3.73) and Health Benefits (3.47) remain important but rank slightly lower.

- **Influence Channels**  
  - **85%** of Gen Zers are likely/very likely to buy a product recommended by a trusted person.  
  - Only **44%** say the same for generic social-media ads.  
  - **54%** would recommend a product they discovered online, highlighting peer advocacy.

## Ideation & Concept

We synthesized these insights into a three-pillar solution that speaks directly to Gen Z’s stated needs:

1. **Social Media Takeover**: “#KindMindz” micro-influencer challenge on TikTok & Instagram to drive social proof and peer recommendations.  
2. **AR Motivation Boards**: QR-triggered in-store AR that delivers positive affirmations and habit-tracking, creating “kindness boosters” in snack aisles.  
3. **KIND Rewards Refresh**: QR-code–driven spin-to-win hub for on-pack rewards, fostering ongoing engagement through free bars, merch, or micro-donations.
