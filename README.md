**Kind Mindz** is a first-place entry in a six-week 
case competition to deepen Gen Z engagement with KIND
Protein Bars. Under the mantra _“clean ingredients 
fuel a KIND mind,”_ we combined consumer surveys, 
competitive analysis, and rapid Figma prototyping to 
deliver three interactive pillars: a #KindMinds social
media challenge, In-store/On-Campus Augmented Reality 
Motivation Boards, a KIND Rewards Refresh. Together,
these elements create a seamless omnichannel 
loop driving both immediate trials (_+6.5% projected
net sales lift_) and longer-term brand loyalty.

**My Role:**  
Led user research (surveys & interviews), conducted brand and market research, synthesized data into personas and word-cloud insights, and designed high-fidelity Figma prototypes of our omnichannel concept.

## The Investigation

### A. Finding the Snack Appeal
KIND provided us with numerous research surrounding 
snacking habits for different demographics on top of
doing our own research on the market, the company itself,
and its competitors

**Bite Sized Facts:**

- In 2022, 17% more consumers began purchasing better-for-you food products (Kantar, 2022).
- 43% of consumers buy snack nuts for their high-protein content, 39% for indulgence, and 36% for heart-health benefits (IRI, 2022).
- “High” claims (e.g., high fiber, high protein) resonate more than “low” claims (e.g., low sugar, low calorie) (Circana, 2023).
- 71% of consumers look specifically for high-protein snacks (Circana, 2023).
- Smartphone apps have become an influential channel for snack purchases (IRI, 2023).
- Partnerships with delivery services and metaverse experiences can drive incremental revenue (IRI, 2022).
- 49% of consumers snack three or more times per day—a 4-point increase over two years—with Gen Z snacking even more frequently (IRI, 2021).
- Evening snacking peaks among all demographics (IRI, 2021).
- 25% of shoppers buy whatever snack is on sale rather than their preferred brand (IRI, 2022).
- 48% of consumers seek out multi-variety snack packs (Circana, 2023).
- Gen Z prioritized health during COVID-19 more than previous generations (Sela & Bareket-Bojmel, 2022).

**Taste Trends:**

- Retailers vary “better-for-you” messaging: Kroger majors on farmers-market freshness; private labels at Aldi, Target, and Publix emphasize innovation (Kantar, 2022; IRI, 2022).
- Health-halo claims differ: indulgent treats tout “zero sugar” or “grass-fed,” while healthy snacks spotlight positive inclusions like “50% more fruit” (IRI, 2022).
- Diet buzzwords (“gluten-free,” “keto”) sway purchase perceptions (Mintel, 2020).
- Specialty grocers (Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s) lead on product-innovation claims, winning healthy-snacker loyalty (Circana, 2023).
- In-store recipe cards for fresh-produce snacks boost shopper engagement (Kantar, 2020).

### B. Understanding the Consumer 

Through the entire six weeks, we studied Gen Zs impression 
of KIND. We had an upper hand given we were aged in
the target demographic so we started with inspecting 
our own access to the brands identity and our peers 
as well. 

**Gen Z Touchpoint Audit**

To ground our research in real-world behavior, our
team conducted an In-Store & Social Scan of KIND 
Bars across local grocery aisles and on the
social platforms Gen Z uses most. 


We mapped shelf placement in campus-area stores,
assessing visibility, neighboring brands, and 
promotional signage, variety, and pricing.

Simultaneously, we reviewed KIND’s TikTok and 
Instagram channels to evaluate content cadence,
engagement tactics, and hashtag performance. 

This dual audit revealed key 
gaps in both physical discoverability and digital 
resonance, informing our omnichannel strategy to 
bridge the in-store experience with compelling social
touchpoints.

#### User Surveys

We ran three different surveys (_n_ ≈ 114) online via 
campus social channels and in person at FAMU & FSU 
student centers :

1. **Brand Awareness Survey** (_n_=60)
2. **Snack Habit Survey** (_n_=41)
3. **Product Testing Survey** (_n_=13)

**Key Questions:**
- Importance ratings (1–5) for Convenience, Taste, Cost, Health Benefits
- Channel of survey encounter (social vs. on-campus)
- Open feedback on likes/dislikes and purchase intent

#### User Personas

#### 1. On-the-Go Olivia
- **Age/Role:** 19, Student Athlete
- **Goals:** Quick, filling snacks; social sharing of snack finds
- **Pain Points:** Time-starved, budget-conscious, hangry but dislikes messy packaging

#### 2. Wellness-Minded Will
- **Age/Role:** 22, Recent Graduate
- **Goals:** Health-forward snacks; transparent nutrition tracking
- **Pain Points:** Skeptical of health claims; struggles to find balance of taste & nutrition

#### 3. Social Sarah
- **Age/Role:** 20, Journalism Major & Micro-influencer
- **Goals:** Trendy, Instagram-worthy snack experiences; peer engagement
- **Pain Points:** Finds traditional marketing stale; seeks tech-savvy, shareable concepts

### C. Discovering the Problem

**Little to No Brand Connection**  
![GenZ Brand Opinion](Insights/GenZ%20Brand%20Opinion.png)
Our surveys and in-person taste tests confirm Gen Z 
snackers simply aren’t connecting with the brand on 
an emotional or cultural level. Our brand-awareness 
survey found that 39 percent of Gen Z respondents 
rated their familiarity with KIND at just 1 out of 
10, indicating very low top-of-mind awareness. Even 
more concerning, many of these same “unaware” snackers
still expressed willingness to purchase a bar, 
suggesting that KIND’s product benefits alone aren’t
driving recognition or loyalty. 

![Purchase Influences](Insights/Purchase%20Influences.png)
Without a meaningful
brand presence, all of KIND’s messaging around clean
ingredients and health benefits risks falling flat,
especially in a crowded snack market where peer 
recommendations and shareable experiences carry 
more weight than traditional “better-for-you” claims.

**Taste & Cost Focus**
![Snack Feature Priority](Insights/Snack%20Feature%20Priority.png)
Taste and Cost remain the most important rated 
features among the target audience. KIND’s 
clean-ingredient commitment results in a slightly
higher price point than many rivals, who often lean 
on added sugars to amplify taste.

![Health Benefit Importance](Insights/Health%20Benefit%20Importance.png)
While health and 
“clean” messaging remain meaningful, emphasizing a 
wallet-friendly, high-protein experience can uniquely
position KIND Protein Bars to capture Gen Z’s 
attention. By leading with irresistible flavor,
clear value, and genuinely nutritious ingredients, 
we can meet Gen Z where they shop and snack, turning
first-time taste trials into repeat purchases.

## The Solution
To address Gen Z’s low resonance yet strong product intent, we spotlight KIND Protein Bars under _“clean ingredients fuel a KIND mind,”_ extending KIND’s pillars—_Kinder to our Bodies, Kinder to our Planet, Kinder to our Communities_—with a fourth: **Kinder to our Mindz**. We ideated three pillars to highlight protein benefits and clean ingredients:


1. **Social Media Takeover**  
  A TikTok- and Instagram-first `#KindMindz` challenge 
inviting users to share bite-sized self-care rituals with KIND Protein bars, amplified by micro-influencer partnerships.
![Social Personas](Design%20Artifacts/SocialPersonas.png)

2. **AR Motivation Boards**  
  In-store QR-triggered AR experiences that overlay 
positive affirmations and habit-tracking 
gamification, transforming routine snack aisles
into interactive “kindness boosters.”
![AR Boards](Design%20Artifacts/ARBoard.png)

3. **KIND Rewards Refresh**  
  A digital spin-to-win rewards hub, accessible via packaging QR codes, letting shoppers earn free bars, exclusive merch, or micro-donations to mental-health nonprofits.
![Rewards Refresh](Design%20Artifacts/RewardsRefresh.png)
Together, these elements create a seamless omnichannel
loop driving both immediate trials (_+6.5% projected 
net sales lift_) and longer-term brand loyalty.
