## Overview

**Kind Mindz** is a first-place entry in a six-week case competition to deepen Gen Z engagement with KIND Protein Bars. Under the mantra _“clean ingredients fuel a KIND mind,”_ we combined consumer surveys, competitive analysis, and rapid Figma prototyping to deliver three interactive pillars:

- **Social Media Takeover**  
  A TikTok- and Instagram-first `#KindMindz` challenge inviting users to share bite-sized self-care rituals with KIND bars, amplified by micro-influencer partnerships.

- **AR Motivation Boards**  
  In-store QR-triggered AR experiences that overlay positive affirmations and habit-tracking gamification, transforming routine snack aisles into interactive “kindness boosters.”

- **KIND Rewards Refresh**  
  A digital spin-to-win rewards hub, accessible via packaging QR codes, letting shoppers earn free bars, exclusive merch, or micro-donations to mental-health nonprofits.

Together, these elements create a seamless omnichannel loop driving both immediate trials (_+6.5% projected net sales lift_) and longer-term brand loyalty.

Over the six-week sprint, our focus was on fast ideation and prototyping, so documentation was streamlined. This summer, I’ve revisited and polished the project—adding comprehensive research notes, detailed documentation, and reflections on future improvements—while this repo serves as a temporary home until my full portfolio site launches.

**My Role:**  
Led user research (surveys & interviews), conducted brand and market research, synthesized data into personas and word-cloud insights, and designed high-fidelity Figma prototypes of our omnichannel concept.

## Problem Statement

> **How can KIND reach Gen Z (born after 1995) snackers to expand household penetration and brand awareness, drive sales and profit, and remain true to KIND’s mission and values?**

## Research & Analysis

### A. Market Research

**Quick Facts:**

- In 2022, 17% more consumers began purchasing better-for-you food products (Kantar, 2022).
- 43% of consumers buy snack nuts for their high-protein content, 39% for indulgence, and 36% for heart-health benefits (IRI, 2022).
- “High” claims (e.g., high fiber, high protein) resonate more than “low” claims (e.g., low sugar, low calorie) (Circana, 2023).
- 71% of consumers look specifically for high-protein snacks (Circana, 2023).
- Smartphone apps have become an influential channel for snack purchases (IRI, 2023).
- Partnerships with delivery services and metaverse experiences can drive incremental revenue (IRI, 2022).
- 49% of consumers snack three or more times per day—a 4-point increase over two years—with Gen Z snacking even more frequently (IRI, 2021).
- Evening snacking peaks among all demographics (IRI, 2021).
- 25% of shoppers buy whatever snack is on sale rather than their preferred brand (IRI, 2022).
- 48% of consumers seek out multi-variety snack packs (Circana, 2023).
- Gen Z prioritized health during COVID-19 more than previous generations (Sela & Bareket-Bojmel, 2022).

**Marketing Trends:**

- Retailers vary “better-for-you” messaging: Kroger majors on farmers-market freshness; private labels at Aldi, Target, and Publix emphasize innovation (Kantar, 2022; IRI, 2022).
- Health-halo claims differ: indulgent treats tout “zero sugar” or “grass-fed,” while healthy snacks spotlight positive inclusions like “50% more fruit” (IRI, 2022).
- Diet buzzwords (“gluten-free,” “keto”) sway purchase perceptions (Mintel, 2020).
- Specialty grocers (Whole Foods, Trader Joe’s) lead on product-innovation claims, winning healthy-snacker loyalty (Circana, 2023).
- In-store recipe cards for fresh-produce snacks boost shopper engagement (Kantar, 2020).

### B. Survey Data Analysis

**Methodology:**  
Over three weeks, we ran three complementary surveys (_n_ ≈ 114):

1. **Brand Awareness Survey** (_n_=60)
2. **Snack Habit Survey** (_n_=41)
3. **Product Testing Survey** (_n_=13)

_Distribution:_ Online via campus social channels and in person at FAMU & FSU student centers and gyms.  
_Key Questions:_
- Importance ratings (1–5) for Convenience, Taste, Cost, Health Benefits
- Channel of survey encounter (social vs. on-campus)
- Open feedback on likes/dislikes and purchase intent

**Key Findings:**
 
![GenZ Brand Opinion](Insights/GenZ%20Brand%20Opinion.png)

![Snack Feature Priority](Insights/Snack%20Feature%20Priority.png)

![Health Benefit Importance](Insights/Health%20Benefit%20Importance.png)

![Purchase Influences](Insights/Purchase%20Influences.png)

- **Low Baseline Brand Sentiment:** 39% of Gen Z rated KIND awareness 1/10, yet 39% of that group would still purchase a bar.
- **Taste & Cost Lead:** Taste (mean 4.50) and Cost (mean 4.20) outrank Convenience (3.73) and Health Benefits (3.47).
- **Health Benefits Matter Less:** Though important (mean 3.47), health trails taste and cost in purchase priority.
- **Convenience & On-the-Go Packaging:** Still a strong secondary driver.
- **Social Influence:** 80%+ likely to buy products seen on social media or via trusted peers.

### C. User Personas

#### 1. On-the-Go Olivia
- **Age/Role:** 19, Student Athlete
- **Goals:** Quick, filling snacks; social sharing of snack finds
- **Pain Points:** Time-starved, budget-conscious, hangry but dislikes messy packaging

#### 2. Wellness-Minded Will
- **Age/Role:** 22, Recent Graduate
- **Goals:** Health-forward snacks; transparent nutrition tracking
- **Pain Points:** Skeptical of health claims; struggles to find balance of taste & nutrition

#### 3. Social Sarah
- **Age/Role:** 20, Journalism Major & Micro-influencer
- **Goals:** Trendy, Instagram-worthy snack experiences; peer engagement
- **Pain Points:** Finds traditional marketing stale; seeks tech-savvy, shareable concepts

## Ideation & Concept

To address Gen Z’s low resonance yet strong product intent, we spotlight KIND Protein Bars under _“clean ingredients fuel a KIND mind,”_ extending KIND’s pillars—_Kinder to our Bodies, Kinder to our Planet, Kinder to our Communities_—with a fourth: **Kinder to our Mindz**. We ideated three pillars to highlight protein benefits and clean ingredients:

1. **Social Media Takeover:**  
   Launch `#KindMindz` micro-influencer challenges on TikTok & Instagram showcasing how KIND Protein Bars fuel daily routines and self-care rituals.

2. **AR Motivation Boards:**  
   In-store QR-triggered AR that overlays positive affirmations and tracks healthy habits when users scan a KIND Protein Bar, turning snack aisles into interactive “kindness boosters.”

3. **KIND Rewards Refresh:**  
   Deploy on-pack QR codes to a spin-to-win hub, letting shoppers earn free protein bars, exclusive merch, or donate to mental-health nonprofits—reinforcing ongoing engagement.

We arrived at this omnichannel solution by merging qualitative insights (surveys, taste tests) with quantitative data (competitive benchmarking), then prototyping in Figma and validating with peer feedback to ensure alignment with Gen Z’s snack priorities: protein, taste, value, and shareability.
